  <code>inquire</code> is a library for building interactive prompts on terminals.
</p>

It provides several different prompts in order to interactively ask the user for information via the CLI. With `inquire`, you can use:

- [`Text`] to get text input from the user, with _built-in autocompletion support_;
- [`Editor`]\* to get longer text inputs by opening a text editor for the user;
- [`DateSelect`]\* to get a date input from the user, selected via an _interactive calendar_;
- [`Select`] to ask the user to select one option from a given list;
- [`MultiSelect`] to ask the user to select an arbitrary number of options from a given list;
- [`Confirm`] for simple yes/no confirmation prompts;
- [`CustomType`] for text prompts that you would like to parse to a custom type, such as numbers or UUIDs;
- [`Password`] for secretive text prompts.
